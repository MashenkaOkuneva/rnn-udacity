# My RNN materials from Udacity 

This repository will remind me of what I learned about RNNs with Udacity.

## Step 1. Simple RNN for time series prediction: sine wave example.

See **time-series** folder.

## Step 2. Character-level RNN.

See **char-rnn** folder.

## Step 3. Learn how to train word embeddings.

See **word2vec-embeddings** folder.

## Step 4. Learn how to use RNN for sentiment anaysis.

See **sentiment-rnn** folder.
